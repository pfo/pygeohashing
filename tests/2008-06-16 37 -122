Just got back from my aborted attempt.  The point appears to be located on the property of [[http://palo-alto-ca.addresses.com/yp_results.php?ReportType=44&MoreInfoResult=1&qrecid=LMS52872667 Boething TreeLand]], a for-wholesalers-only tree farm; "Golf Lane" is the driveway leading into the place.  I tried entering on foot, from the north, got as far as their front office, then saw a sign pointing towards the desired direction labeled "Private Residence - No Entry".  Didn't really feel like dealing with potentially needing permission from both TreeLand ''and'' a random resident, so I went back to Alpine Road and got to Golf Lane via a parking lot opposite La Mesa Drive.  Saw plenty of "This is property of TreeLand" signage from that direction, which makes me pretty sure about whom one would need to get clearance from.  Had been out at "lunch" for way too long at that point to warrant heading back to their front office, explaining my goals to the office person there, and trundling across their property and back - and ''certainly'' wasn't going to just start milling around their lot during business hours - so I scotched my attempt <0.2 miles short.  Sigh.  Hope the above proves remotely helpful to somebody else out there, though! --[[User:Youhas|Youhas]] 00:16, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

Sounds like Youhas and I were there around the same time. I drove up what I guessed was Golf Lane, past the "Treeland Wholesale Only" sign (with attached 2923 sign -- I assume the Alpine Rd address). After passing lots of trees in overgrown wooden "flower pots" I saw the same driveway leading to a private residence and turned my Jeep around there. Not sure what the rules are regarding how close is "close enough" to score a hexpoint, (it's 100 meters in geodashing) but I certainly wasn't close enough to call this one a success. Next time! --[[User:Buxley|Buxley]] 01:37, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

I was able to get to the point, ran into TW there, and hopefully will have bad cell pictures to post later.  There was no one around to ask if it was ok to go in, but also no signs saying "stop here" - I kept following the signs to the office, hoping to find someone, then figured I'll just stay on the roads until I get there.

: That seems to be as viable an approach as any.  And hey, very glad to hear that at least ''somebody'' was able to successfully make it out to the hash point in question.  Congratulations! --[[User:Youhas|Youhas]] 07:28, 17 June 2008 (UTC)



Yes, I also biked there and took the fuzzy camera photo.  The only private property sign I noticed was only for a small side road, and not the main road that ran through the middle to the spot in question.  Still, it was a dirt road through a nursery that closes at 5pm, so I half expected someone to tell us to leave, but no one did.  --[[User:tw|tw]] 18:00, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

== Planning ==

Looks like an easy one for any Stanford-area geohashers: Just off Alpine Road, possibly in private land (Please Do Not Tresspass).  I'll try to check it out, but it's going to be late (like, 8:30pm or later). Hopefully someone will scout it before then and let me know what to expect ;-) --[[User:Tapin|Tapin]] 17:47, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

I might drop by on the way home from work. Would be leaving RWC at around 4pm. [[User:FunkyTuba|FunkyTuba]] 19:36, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

Ugh - close enough, but not really the sort of journey I'd care to make during drive-time hours.  Will see if I can't shift things around here at work and do a mid-afternoon "lunch" hour to scout things out, though. --[[User:Youhas|Youhas]] 19:56, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

I'll swing by there on the ride home, around 6:30pm or so. [[User:Zigdon|Zigdon]] 20:16, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

I missed the canonical 4PM meet time, but will see how close I can get on my way home ~6ish. --[[User:Buxley|Buxley]] 23:55, 16 June 2008 (UTC)
