Thursday's geohash for northern [[Adelaide, Australia|Adelaide]] was on the side of the road in the far northern suburbs in Munno Para.

It wasn't close enough to the road to get the [[Speed Racer Achievement]] :-(


== People ==
One group (around 4:30 pm) turned up
* [[User:Karcean|Nathan]] and [[User:Bobthefish|BobTheFish]]
