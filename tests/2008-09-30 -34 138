== Location ==

The geohash on the 30th of September 2008 for the Northern Graticule of [[Adelaide, Australia|Adelaide]] . Located in the Northeastern suburbs, conveniently in a park rather than anyone's back yard or house. Specifically it was located on a concrete drain which was presented in a mildly artistic way. At first look it appeared to be a fountain (see photo below) but on further investigation it was discovered to be a drain.

== People ==
* [[User:Karcean|Nathan]] and [[User:Bobthefish|BobTheFish]] arrived at about 3:55pm and hung around for 10 mins or so, then got bored and left.

* and later (again) [[User:UnwiseOwl|UnwiseOwl]] at around 6pm

==UnwiseOwl's Uneccesary Narrative==

Oh wow! For the first time since I started caching, there's an urban hash, and what's more it's not in someones backyard but in a park near what appears to be a giant concrete snake. And so it was than one excited hasher jumped in his car after work and braved the peak hour traffic to reach the hash. Thanks to the rather obvious concrete snake (which I also was most suprised to find was a drain) I was able to reach the location without the use of technology, and could be sure I was there because of the nice little beacon left by my predecessors.

I settled down for a picnic for an hour or so, hoping that others would turn up, noting with amusement that had it been winter thiscould have qualified as a water geohash. Noone else appeared, though, so I devoured the biscuits and fizzy lemon goodness all by myself, and began a game of scrabble. It was the perfect place for a picnic, and I watched the sun go down while contemplating the best use of double letter scores. Eventually, though, the mosquitos got the better of me and it was time to go.

On my way home I noticed a vendor of ice comestibles. So I went in and said "Hi. I'm from the internet. Give me the biggest cup of icy red thing you've got". I got a funny look from the gal behind the counter, but I also got my squishy. Further opportunity to bring the silly when I accidentally walked into the playground instead of the exit: "I think I'm lost, is this Myspace?". I then beat a hasty retreat, stopping only to get a nicely blurred happy snap. Then back to the hash to claim 5 squishy hash points. The squishy, just in case you're interested, tasted like sugary sweet victory.

Oh and I almost died 'cause of idiots on the way home.
