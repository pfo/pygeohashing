== About ==

In the rightmost lane of east-bound Broward Blvd, near Hiatus Road.

Today, Fate ([http://www.erfworld.com/book-1-archive/?px=%2F038a.jpg or Erf, or Numbers]) gave us a quite reachable weekday hash point, but it also gave us some [http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KFXE/2009/6/23/DailyHistory.html?req_city=Sunrise&req_state=FL&req_statename=Florida seriously crappy weather]. [[User:Million_zillion|Million_zillion]] was able to attend because of convenience. [[User:Aperfectring|Aperfectring]] could not, due to his desire not to drive more than he had to in severe thunderstorms. These were more sparse by the time he would have had to leave, but there were still some concerning blips on the radar, so he decided that there will always be more hashpoints.

The weather was not cooperating at all for most of the day (there were reports of 60-70 mph winds and hail, which I didn't see), but by about 7pm things had calmed down and the rain was very light. This hash point was only about 3 miles from my office, so I went for it after work. On arrival, I started by [[Speed_racer_achievement|Speed Racer]]ing through the hashpoint at about 7:25pm.

By this time the rain was barely a drizzle, so I decided to park by some nearby houses on the other side of the street and take a few pictures. As it turns out, there's not much to see, at least from this vantage point.

By the time I left (and drove through the hash point a second time), the rain had stopped. It was clear skies the whole way home. Go figure.
