Today's hashpoint was in the area of must-visit. Distance to the point was only 1,3 km as the crow flies and one could practically see it from our front steps. But of course things weren't quite that simple, as there is a river between our house and the point and while the river was frozen, the ice could only hold the weight of a hare at maximum. Pastori does weigh a little bit more than a rabbit, so we had to make a detour. Winter is already making its way to Pastori's neck of the woods; in the morning the temperature was at minus 18 degrees centigrade and there was a slight sheet of snow on the ground. Therefore an auxiliary engine heater was needed to get the car going, but luckily there is one in every car around this part of the world. After an hour of warming the car up it started up nicely and Wife and our daughter, who happened to be visiting, hopped in. The snowman in our yard wanted to join in, but unfortunately there wasn't enough room in our Yaris.

The detour around the river was 2,5 km and from there we had to stroll across a snowy and icy field. Distance to the point was 750 metres as the crow flies. The sun was shining and the air was brisk so the stroll until the edge of the wood was quite nice. However, from there the distance was still 250 metres in the thick of the forest where some clearing of the trees had been done previously but the felled trees had just been left to decay. But not that and not anything stopped Pastori from determinedly aiming his steps towards the point, which was found among the snowy spruce trees at an accuracy of about 3,5 metres. After that we could head back while keeping an eye on the tracks left by the forest animals in the snowy ground. We saw the tracks of hares, foxes, deer, grouse, field mice, field voles and an EU inspector.

The facts of our trip: 5 km by car, 2 km on foot and overall time used 1 hour.
