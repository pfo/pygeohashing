This one falls at 12 Park Rd, Woonona.  The train station is conveniently nearby.

This hash was reached by me ([[User:DancingMan|DancingMan]]) at 15:50.  I remained until 16:20, but no-one else showed up while I was there.  Possibly, this had something to do with the gloomy, drizzling weather.

This suburb is mostly residential, single & double storey houses; a lot of them look quite new, or at least, have been given a lick of paint recently.  There's a beach at the end of the road, but owing to the miserable weather, I didn't bother to go look.

Park Rd itself was far busier than I anticipated; there was a car going past at least every 10 seconds.

A couple of residents of No.12 arrived while I was waiting, however, they didn't look particularly friendly, so I didn't approach.

I ([[User:Mephistopheles|Mephistopheles]]) missed the designated time, but I did manage to get there at about 17:45.
Google's satellite photo showed the spot within number 10, so that's what my photo is of.
It was dark, so I had to use flash, and I didn't want anyone coming out to abuse me, so I only got the one shot (it's the one of the white fence).
