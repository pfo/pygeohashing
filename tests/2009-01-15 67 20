Usually hashpoints in [[Kiruna, Sweden | our graticule]] are deep in the woods, far out of reach. This one was located in the city of Kiruna, near the Porfyren residental area and just below the Luossavaara ski slope. Getting there was easy. [[User:the_ru | the ru]] went. It's a popular area to go for a walk in so there were plenty of tracks, but probably none from other geohashers.

The temperature was merely -10 C, not nearly cold enough to break the current record. But it was still damn cold when operating the GPS bare-handed.

'''Update''': Hey! I just realized this also qualified for a Cubicle Geohash almost honorable mention!
