This is the geohash for the [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]](Well south east QLD - the actual Brisbane graticule ends up either in the ocean or further up north depending on how you play with the whole °s.) graticule on [[2008-05-24]]. This Geohash was choosen as it was almost in a National Park and did not require a boat. 
Located just on the edge of [http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/parks_and_forests/find_a_park_or_forest/moogerah_peaks_national_park/#getting_there_and_getting_around Moogerah Peaks National park] this required a 2KM walk through wooded cattle property. These photos were taken about 20m from the actual Geohash, due to to the actual location being in a gully with heavy lantana.
