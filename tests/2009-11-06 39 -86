__NOTOC__
== Location ==
About a mile north of Lake Monroe near Moore Creek.

== Participants ==
[[User:ErWenn|Erik]], Kira, and Duncan.

== Expedition ==
The hash looked accessible, about a hundred feet off of Moores Creek Road, so we went for it. If I (Erik) had looked at a map instead of just the satellite photos, I would have realized that it was practically sitting in Moore Creek. (Notice how the creek is just "Moore Creek", but the road is "Moore<strong>s</strong> Creek"? Ah, naming conventions.) Duncan was a little wary about the leaves covering the ground, but eventually he warmed up to it and became his usual straining-at-the-end-of-his-leash-if-you-pause-for-more-than-five-seconds self. The creek was so shallow, that I thought it might be a good candidate for the [[Walking on water geohash achievement]]. I'll post to the talk pages there to see if it counts as enough water. I mean it is a body of water that shows up on maps (if only as a thin blue line)... Within the margin of error of my GPS receiver, there were spots that were probably ankle-deep, parts that were completely dry, and parts that were about half a centimeter deep (which is where I'm standing in the picture below).

We also attempted a nearby (0.9 miles) [[Hash collision achievement|geocache]], but it got too dark, so we had to give up.
