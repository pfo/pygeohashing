==Location==
This location fell right in the middle of the Sydney suburb of Marsfield. Even better than that it was right at the front of a driveway on Patricia St. This geohash was going to be a nice and easy one...

'''Kate's Report'''<br>
The hashpoint was sort of on my way to work, so I swung by after stopping at a newsagent to buy chalk.
Getting there was quite uneventful however, I did see two particularly strange things:
* At the bakery around the corner was a man who, in between ordering a pie and a chocolate donut, clucked like a chicken.
* While I was sitting in my car, across the road from the house I saw a man walking backwards up the street.

It was a weird place... 

I left a 'the internet was here' letter in their mailbox and (with my new chalk) wrote XKCD on the street and drew a stick man.

That bit was fun!


'''Shady's Report'''<br>
Ramos and I were playing Putt Putt golf in nearby Melrose Park with some friends in the evening, so I suggested we could visit the hash point on our way home. After finishing Putt Putt at about 10, Ramos and I along with two of our friends headed to the hash point, arriving at about 10:15. After explaining to our friends what geohashing actually is (and why we were taking a random, long way home), we took a group photo before heading home.


'''CJ's Report'''<br>
I got home this evening to discover that the hashpoint was located a mere seven and a half kilometres from my house. Better than that in was easily accessible as it was right at the front of someone's driveway. Owing to the fact that the co-ordinates haven't been 'settling' properly over the past few days until a few hours after the opening of the Dow, it meant this was a chance to attempt a midnight geohash as this would be the first midnight to come around since the location was known (in Sydney we normally have half an hour after the co-ordinates are released at 11.30pm local time).

Google Maps estimated the drive would take 17 mins. Turns out it only took 7 mins (which is good, seeing as I left home at 11.45pm). I arrived at the location at 11.52pm and had a few minutes to scout out the area. I took a wander up the street which was incredibly quiet. Seems like everyone was sound asleep. Every noise I made was really loud and I didn't want to disturb the neighbours.

I made sure I was back at the hashpoint with a few minutes to spare. Eventually I managed to get a half-decent photo of the house in the dark (see below), and by now it was just before the stroke of midnight. I went over to the hashpoint and snapped a few quick pics using the flash (and hoping I wouldn't wake the occupants of the house). At this point the dog across the road noticed me and started barking like crazy. Time to get out of there! As soon as I was out of his direct sight though he went silent again. Phew. I decided my work was done, and headed home. A successful (if brief) midnight geohash!
