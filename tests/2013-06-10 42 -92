__NOTOC__
== Location ==
Iowa corn field

== Plans ==
Another stop on the way from Wisconsin to Kansas City.

== Expedition ==
This is the third stop in a multihash (see [[2013-06-10_42_-91|previous]] or [[2013-06-10_41_-93|next]]).

This was a failure almost immediately: the road to the hash from Highway 20 was closed.  The GPS offered an alternate route, but I was starting to feel some pressure to get on the road, so I didn't persist.
