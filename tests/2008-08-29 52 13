== About ==

Too good not to go. An [[Easy Geohash|easy one]], not even 5km from [[User:Relet|Relet]]'s place. Moreover, it's right next to the lake where he proposed to [[User:lyx|lyx]]. He went in the morning, while doing some shopping and stuff for his holidays. Took some photos, some screenshots, and mused about the message scribbled on a doggy bag (the other kind) dispenser nearby.

The hash was on a public place, with some greenery and benches. People were exercising around the lake, and some cafeteria owner cleaning his terrace.
