==Alternate Location==
[[Image:gift.PNG|left|I brought you something....]] Today's location is [yet another] inaccessible watershed/wilderness location in the north. The alternate location for today's geohash is at [[User:Robyn|Robyn's]] Birthday Party, within a few blocks of N49.24 W123.07. All geohashers welcome, even if you haven't met me yet. It is a (Douglas Adams) Life, the Universe and Everything party. Costumes optional. Contact Robyn for more precise coordinates. -[[User:Robyn|Robyn]] 17:10, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

==Participants==
I can't make it, but I will try to send a [[Puppet Master Geohash|proxy]] or a [[Hashcard achievement|card]] :-) -- [[User:Jevanyn|Jevanyn]]
I'll do my best! But I'm not sure what time I'll be free... [[User:Thepiguy|Thepiguy]] 20:34, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
I'll try to participate by going to the right co-ordinates in my graticule, dressed for the occasion. -- [[User:UnwiseOwl|UnwiseOwl]] 23:18, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
Costume? Like, "''bring a towel''"? Or am I confusing different books by the same author?--[[User:Zb|Zb]] 20:35, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
:A towel would be a perfectly acceptable costume, yes. I was thinking of dressing as a Hoovaloo. -Robyn
::Yay! I will be joining dressed up as a SEP. -- [[User:relet|relet]] 20:58, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
:::I plan to hurl myself at the party...and miss. --[[User:Starbird|starbird]] 12:56, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

==Birthday Wishes from those who can't come==
Happy Birthday from almost the same latitude, but with an offset in longitude of 135 E, provided I did the math right. Enjoy the party! --[[User:Zb|Zb]] 10:49, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
:Happy Birthday Robyn! (just in case you can't see me when blinking, in the corner of your eyes.) -- [[User:relet|relet]] 14:51, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
::Late birthday wishes from me, Robyn. I was thinking of you, but stranded without internet and transport. Sounds like a blast, anyway, my towel and I salute you. -- [[User:UnwiseOwl|UnwiseOwl]] 23:13, 22 March 2009 (UTC)
:::Here's a late birthday greeting from very sunny Sydney. Glad to see you had a lovely day! --[[User:Kate|Kate]] 01:08, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
And best birthday wishes from brutally sunny Florida.  Great report of an apparently great party.  Love the picture.  I see you let your hair grow; looking good.  Wish I lived in BC.  Thinking of immigrating.  People there as crazy as I.  No greater wisdom than that in HHGTTG (and incidentally TDTESS). --[[User:Bos|Bos]] 17:52, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

Congratulations! --[[User:The ru|The ru]] 08:33, 25 March 2009 (UTC)

==Expedition==

It was a marvellous party with friends, Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters, dolphins, a large bowl of petunias, people with fish in their ears, towels and lots of bathrobes, but although one person attended in an xkcd t-shirt and had heard of geohashing, he staunchly denied any interest or intention of ever geohashing, so sadly no other geohashers attended the alternate location and it can't be counted.

Two others who drove up from Seattle for the party, are ninjas whom I introduced to the sport. They've actually attended a few geohashes on their own, seen chalk marks left by others, but never marked nor wiki-documented their expeditions. They are out there!  I didn't think they could be counted as geohashers attending the geohash, as they didn't know it was a designated alternate. Or can I count them, and thus this attempt as a point towards the xkcd 100?

Vancouver graticule, despite our inhospitable geography, seems to just not do alternates.
