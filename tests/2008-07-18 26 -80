Aperfectring played parent to Red cordial and Tim Tams on the way to this hash.  First I had to prepare transportation, my old backpack should do the trick!  Then I had to ensure that they would be safe in case we had an unfortunate accident.  Red cordial and Tim Tams were very impatient on the drive and kept asking "Are we there yet?" so I gave them the GPS to shut them up.  On the way to the hash location, we spotted a sign telling us to be on the lookout for alligators!  While walking along side the detention pond right next to the hash, we spotted some waterfowl basking in the South Florida sun.  The actual hash location was fairly boring.  It was an apartment/condo building's frontage to the detention pond. After returning home, I made myself a nice refreshing pitcher of cordial!
