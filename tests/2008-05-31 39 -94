Is anybody in the graticule just south of KC, currently labelled as [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]]? I'm going to be in that area this Saturday and if the coordinates are close and I knew other people would be there I might give it a visit. - [[User:Histumness|Histumness]] 22:17, 29 May 2008 (UTC)
* I might be there if that location point is closer to my house than the Kansas City one. And if I can go this time. - [[User:MythGuy|MythGuy]]
* Ooh, actually the regular K.C. one is really close to where I'll be driving to get to the Harrisonville area tomorrow. Looks like it's [http://irc.peeron.com/xkcd/map/map.html?date=2008-05-31&lat=39&long=-94&zoom=12 in the woods behind some people's houses]. I might possibly stop by there around 1 - 3 PM with bocce. Residential forest bocce! - [[User:Histumness|Histumness]] 20:28, 30 May 2008 (UTC)
* I plan on being there, just not sure what time yet. - [[User:sibernetik|SibernetiK]]
* I was planing on being at the KC point tomorrow around the official time, but I could be convinced to come out earlier for residential forest bocce. Could you give any more of a specific time for your arrival?  If not, I'll probably show up around 3 to see if I can catch you, and stay till past four to catch anyone showing up for the official time.  If the woods/backyard is inaccessible, or our presence there causes people to yell, could we agree to meet in the cul-de-sac to the south, NW Wildwood Drive?  Google maps seems to think that is the road closest to the coordinates. [[user:Giraffatitan|Giraffatitan]]
* I actually have to take that all back, the friend I was going to bring with had car trouble in Bolivar and I have to go pick her up.  I'm hoping I'll be able to come next week though. [[user:Giraffatitan|Giraffatitan]]

* Hope I didn't get anybody's hopes up with talks of bocce. I wasn't able to make it. - [[User:Histumness|Histumness]] 20:37, 1 June 2008 (UTC)
