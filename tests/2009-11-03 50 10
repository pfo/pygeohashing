== Expedition==
===[[User:Danatar|Danatar]]===
I started a little earlier than usual today and used my usual route to work. On the second to last traffic light I took the other direction, towards the north of Schweinfurt. Shortly after (and after turning around once because I saw a sign too late) I saw the hashmeadow and parked the car on the roadside next to it. A few steps into the wet meadow and I was at the hashpoint. Coordinates reached, one more district visited! Picture, picture, picture, back to the car and then to work.

Total detour: 4.4 km, 16 minutes.
