Not wanting to waste his final day off before school [[user:thepiguy|thepiguy]] made an epic bike trip that culminated in the perfect water geohash!

And a quick panorama too.

==Location==
The hash point was located 250 meters off the shore in Lee Bay at Pender Harbor.

==Planning==
I didn't start class until noon the next day, so I decided to resurrect my original plans from my [[2008-08-16 48 -123|last big geohash.]] I was going to bike to the ferry terminal, then bike up through Sechelt to Pender harbor and rent a kayak for the rest of the trip. Luckily for me, Pender harbor is a fairly busy piece of water, and there were multiple places to rent a boat from.

==Expedition==
Since I wanted to catch the first ferry out of Horseshoe Bay, I decided to leave my house at 3:00 in the morning. I hadn't gotten to bed until 10:00 the night before (and I only got around 3 hours sleep), but I some how mannaged to drag myself out of bed, onto my bike and set off into the dark.

Things started out well. I had to pace myself on the bike at the beginning (I had a long day ahead!) but I made it out of Richmond and through Vancouver without incident. My first worry is that I was, once again, going to get myself lost in Stanley Park. But, good planning prevailed and I managed to get to the causeway and over the Lions Gate bridge without having to take any trails or bike the wrong way on a one way street.

Marine drive turned out to be more of an effort this time around, but I was still wide awake and made it to the ferry by 5:30. The first ferry to Langdale wasn't until 7:25, so I had a little bit of a wait ahead of me. It was at this point that I realized I had only brought a cycling and a reflective vest, but no coat. I tried to huddle behind my bike, but the crappy chairs made my legs fall asleep. I had my usual ferry breakfast with a side of bacon for extra energy. I was going to take a nap too, but the ferry ride is only 40 minutes long and I barely put my head down before we arrived.

Once in Langdale I had to immediately tackle the giant spirit breaking hill that protected the rest of the sunshine coast from unworthy cyclists. By the time I reached Sechelt, the 3 hours sleep was starting to run out and I decided to take a nap on a nice block of concrete I found by the side of the road. My sleep now totaling 3 hours and 20 minutes, I set off again. Although I had planned my journey carefully, I hadn't counted on the "hilly" nature of highway 101. It took me almost 5 hours to bike the 70km into Garden Bay,

The marina was located behind the local pub, so I locked up my bike (read: hid it behind a bush) and headed down to the dock. The women at the rental shop was very happy and didn't question why I only needed a kayak for 2 hours or the exact nature of my previous kayaking experience (read: almost none).

I stowed all of my valuables in their respective water tight containers and boarded my small neon orange vessel. I had rented a recreational kayak, meaning it was a lot wider and stable than your average kayak. Which was good, because it meant I didn't earn the drowned rat achievement. Paddling turned out to be a heck of a lot more work than biking. Fortunately it was rather easy on my legs, so at least the lower half of my body got a break. My GPS has great maps on it, but every time I stopped to take my bearing I ended up drifting towards undesirable obstacles such as large pointy rocks or power boats. I managed to stay pretty close to land and navigate myself to Lee bay and to the general location.

Which brought me to my next obstacle; how to actually reach the coordinates. It had never occurred to me that the first 141km would be easier than those last 50 meters. Fist of all, there is a distinct lack of landmarks in the middle of the water (and only now, as I type that sentence, does the sheer irony hit me. I guess there's a reason they're called <i>land</i>marks.) which means I had to navigate using only the GPS bearing and a compass. Which, normally, wouldn't be that hard; if not for the fact that it is impossible to stay stationary in moving water. Every time I stopped to see where I was and which direction I had to go, I would start drifting in a random direction. If that wasn't bad enough, the kayak also usually turned as it drifted, meaning it was nearly impossible to accurately use the compass. Every time I paddled in any direction I had no more than 15 seconds to check the GPS, figure out how much I had over shot, align the compass and start paddling again before I had moved too far off course. I ended up just taking random shots at where I guessed it was. If you look at the track log you can see where it goes sort of crazy while I was paddling in circles.

I ended up getting exact coordinates (I assume purely by luck) and even get a decent shot of the GPS too. Once the rush of actually having reached a seemingly impossible set of coordinates wore off, I decided to call a few friends. How often does one get the chance to call people from a kayak? When I finally decided to start heading back I realized that I was now about 25m from the shore. D'oh!

I made it back to land without too much trouble. I need to pay more attention to other boats though, they kept sneaking up on me. It took me about a half hour to sort all of my stuff back into my panniers, but I started the long trip back around 16:30. It was about 15 minutes (and the first hill) later when I realized I was in serious trouble. That lack of sleep combined with the 7ish hours I had already spent cycling had finally hit me. I had to stop after every hill and sometimes take breaks in the middle of them. I estimated that I was going to reach the ferry terminal at around 22:30, which was almost an hour <i>after</i> the last ferry back to Vancouver. So sure was I, that I was going to be spending the night at the ferry terminal; I was already starting to think of ways to build a sleeping bag out of garbage bags and duct tape.

It was half way up a particularly large hill that I stopped/collapsed on the side of the road to have a snack. I was rummaging through my bag when I came across a Clif Shot energy gel that I had bought as a joke. "What the hell" I thought, I might as well give it a try. First of all, these thing may be the worst tasting product yet developed by man kind. I nearly gagged on the three mouth fulls of what was supposedly "strawberry" flavored gel. Secondly, energy gel should be a controlled substance. Not only did I make it in time to catch the ferry, I made it back with an hour and a half to spare. I was simultaneously relieved that I wouldn't have to spend the night in Gibsons and terrified that 32 grams of semi liquid caffeine could affect my body in such a way. On the plus side, I was wide awake when I finally reached the 3km hill down to the ferry terminal. My crappy bike speedometer maxed out at 50km/h, which isn't all that fast, but fact that it <i>stayed</i> maxed out for a full <i>5 minutes</i> was rather fun.

My victory, however, was rather short lived when I realized that I now had to spend 1.5 coatless hours at the ferry terminal and then still had another 45km left once I got to Vancouver. I hung out in the waiting room, which was a little warmer than outside, and had another delicious ferry meal on the way back.

Needless to say, I made it the rest of the way back. I can't remember much after I got off of the ferry, but I got home around 1:30 in the morning, a little over 22 hours after I had left.

==Thanks==
Special thanks goes to [[user:srs0|srs0]]. Although he couldn't come, he let me text message him over 20 times throughout the day so that he could tell search and rescue where to start looking in case I never came home!

He also made the panorama. If it looks a little choppy, that's because it was how I wanted it, believe me; he'd still be working on it otherwise.

==Discussion==
This was posted on my user page before, during and after the hash. I took it off my page, but I'm sentimental and I didn't want to delete it (that or just a digital pack rat):

:I'm getting up in 6 hours; I've got 7 litres of gator aid in the fridge, three changes of clothes and a kayak rental at a marina over 100km away. If I'm never seen alive again, I want my ashes spread over each Vancouver geohash location for the next month. Let's hope it wont come to that...
