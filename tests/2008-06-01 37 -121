== Planning details ==

'''Note:''' This was originally posted in the [[2008-06-01 37 -122|SF graticule]]

== Logistics ==

* [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.349107,-121.916239 Google Maps link]
* Nice, convenient location that just happens to be completely impractical: Highway 880 exit to Coleman Ave, in the dirt next to the off-ramp.
** Easy access by foot, suggest parking on nearby Spring Street.
*** The entire length of Spring Street is marked "No Stopping Any Time".  I suggest parking in the dirt lot at Hedding and  Walnut (about 100 feet down Hedding from the intersection of Hedding and Coleman) --[[User:Tapin|Tapin]] 18:04, 1 June 2008 (UTC)
****Umm, I'm confused by these instructions. It doesn't look like Walnut intersects with Hedding at all, and it seems a bit out of the way. Maybe someone could provide a link to the spot you mean? --[[User:Mystitat|Mystitat]]
*****Sorry, yes, Google Maps doesn't seem to list the road, but it's definitely there and marked.  Walnut continues to the southeast of the very center of [http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=37.347119,-121.913969&spn=0.00229,0.004367&t=h&z=18 this] picture; the dirt lot I referenced is to the northwest of Hedding at that spot. You can see the points where the road is ''supposed'' to go in that map, but it's an old picture. --[[User:Tapin|Tapin]] 19:27, 1 June 2008 (UTC)
* Now taking suggestions for local establishments at which to meet -- Google Earth suggests there's a Quizno's just past Hedding on the southwest side of Coleman?
* [[User:Ted|I]] suggest that we meet at the actual spot as best we can (NOTE: do not cross the freeway illegally!) at 4:00pm, get a few pictures, discuss actual "sit down meet-up" locations and leave by 4:15.  In addition, I will bring the makings of a small, make-shift marker for this most infamous of meetups, hopefully to be buried under layers of concrete and discovered eons hence by future archeologists...  :)
** The actual spot is mildly difficult, not to mention marked "No pedestrians" (which I, uh, noticed on the way back).  However, there's a huge empty dirt field directly east of the spot that's extremely easily accessible. --[[User:Tapin|Tapin]] 18:04, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

== Intended attendees ==

* I'll certainly be there. [[User:Zigdon|Zigdon]] 20:02, 30 May 2008 (UTC)
* I'll be there, possibly with one or two others. Closest places I can think of are a cheap sandwich shop and a Mexican restaurant at the corner of Elm and Emory, just a few blocks away, but I've never eaten there.  There are also several good restaurants (Pasta Pomodoro, Roxie's New York Pizza, Tee Nee Thai), all located a short distance away on the Alameda at Race Street. [[User:Archchancellor|Archchancellor]] 21:25, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
*I'll try my darndest to be there. [[User:Mystitat|Mystitat]]
*I'll be there... not sure how many kids I'll bring. Mmmmm. Pizza. [[User:FunkyTuba|FunkyTuba]] 06:54, 1 June 2008 (UTC)
* [[User:Ted|Ted]] and Vicki will try to be there.
* I'll try to be there --[[User:Tapin|Tapin]] 19:47, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

== Execution/aftermath ==

* [[User:Tapin|Joe]] scouted the spot at about 10am
* [[User:foobert|foobert]]: I had prior commitments at the designated time.  But, on my way there, I drove the northbound on-ramp at 2:50PM. There were 2 hashers sitting against the barrier under the sign. I honked repeatedly, they jumped up and waived energetically. Even at 30 mph, I felt the bond. Blue Jetta wagon ring a bell for anyone?
* [[User:Ted|Ted]] Made it to the spot @4pm[-ish] with others.  Vicki hung out on the other side of the "Absolutely no pedestrians, for any reason, ever; this means you" sign.
* [[User:Mystitat|Mystitat]] Arrived to base camp at 4:00ish. Hung out on the safe side of the fence while contact was made, then enjoyed Quiznos deliciousness.
