== About ==
The day's geohash coordinates fell on the south side of a gravel road along a corn field.

[[User:excellentdude|excellentdude]]: When the day's fractions were announced, I was quite excited.  To begin with, two graticules northwest of where I live the local hash point fell in a national park I've been wanting to visit on the shores of Lake Michigan.  Therefore, geohashing gave me an excuse to go up there and check things out.  Of course, traveling that far might give me a chance to reach some other hash points in between.  As I began clicking around the map between here and there, I found a plethora of reachable hash points!  If planned out correctly, I could have a geohashing day that could equal (or perhaps even exceed) [[User:Relet|relet]]'s prolific [[2008-08-16|geohashing day]] of a year before.  I sold my girlfriend on the idea of geohashing our way to the national park, but then we remembered we told someone in our town that we'd help them move at 7pm that evening.  We'd have to be quick, but we decided to see what we could do.

We left East Lansing at 7:15am.  It was a pretty cool and cloudy morning, particularly for August.  Just 45 minutes after we left, we found ourselves in the neighborhood of our first hash point in the graticule west of our home graticule.  The satellite photo showed the point to be on a road between a couple houses.  It was correct!  I parked my car a bit before the first house, and we proceeded on foot to the hash point.  It took a moment to get my GPS to settle on the right spot, but when it did we took the usual pictures.

Not wanting to waste time when we had potentially much more scenic hashes in mind, we quickly went back to my car and continued our journey.  If we had more time, we might have gone to the hash point in the next graticule west ([[Holland, Michigan]]).  However, this one appeared to be a good ways into what was probably a very tall corn field at this point.  Also, it wasn't as much on the path to the subsequent hashes we had in mind as we might have liked.  So we decided to forgo the Holland hash and proceed directly to [[2009-08-23 43 -86|our next hash attempt]] in the [[Muskegon, Michigan]] graticule.  As we did, I drove through the hash for a speed racer ribbon.  :-)
