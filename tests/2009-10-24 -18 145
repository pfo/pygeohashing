==Location==

Out in the wilds of the [[Abergowrie, Australia|Abergowrie]] graticule.  A couple of miles along Greenvale Camel Creek Rd, then either a 550m hike through "scrub" (with possibility of fences) or a ~1km drive/hike along what appears to be a clearing for powerlines...

==Plan==

I'm planning to head out there this morning with my girls and see if we can reach the point.  Estimating two hours from town.  It's not a likely one, but I'm really keen to get a birthday hash, not to mention a new-for-me grat, another cherry, and another '''green tick'''.  Please be no fences...  {{User:Mattyk/sig|20:45, 9 October 2009 (UTC)}}

==[[User:Mattyk|Matty K]]'s Expedition==

Here's the [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=-18.829,145.8979&daddr=-18.8684224345096,145.39174890259977&hl=en&geocode=FTix4P4drDmyCA%3BFToX4P4dhYCqCA&mra=ls&sll=-18.861458,145.746689&sspn=0.380767,0.525284&ie=UTF8&ll=-18.857559,145.640945&spn=0.380776,0.786896&t=h&z=10 Google map] of where we got to (A) and where we were going (B).

After a very long, slightly random drive up north, out west, over dirt roads and up the sides of mountains, we reached a crossroads I didn't recognise.  The girls were bored and hungry, I was watching the clock run down, and we'd already used a quarter of a tank of fuel, so we called it an "aventure" and turned around.

Several photos were snapped on the return down Mt Fox.  Highlights may be posted here some time.
