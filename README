How to set up aperfectbot:

* Get a bot user.  This makes it so the bot's edits don't flood recent changes on the wiki, and makes it apparent that these edits were done automatically.
* Download pywikibot module.
* Generally follow these instructions https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot/Use_on_third-party_wikis
	* Generate the geohashing family based on those instruction.
	* Use the login script to log into the bot, then it should save a cookie so that it can keep operating in the background forever.
* Generate a full date list for automatic updating of old date pages.
	* python datelist_gen.py > aperfectbot_updates.txt
* Generate the graticules database (this took about 15 minutes last time I ran it)
	* Run the buildGraticuleDatabase.py script with pywikibot.
	* It will count up multiple times (one for each "All Graticules" page).
* Manually run the bot once in the directory you intend to run it from normally, to ensure things are going well
	* Check the recent changes on the wiki to see if there are a bunch of destructive edits.
* Start up a cron job to run the bot automatically
	* Here's the one I used forever:
* * * * * cd /path/to/pywikibot; if [ ! -e aperfectbot.lock ]; then date > aperfectbot.lock; python pwb.py /path/to/pygeohashing/aperfectbot.py >output.txt 2>&1 ; rm aperfectbot.lock; fi
